# Knowledge-Based-AI
Project done in Fall 2014 for CS 7637

The projects were to create an agent to solve Ravens Matrices.
	-	The 1st project has a 2x2 Ravens Matrix that is solved
	-	The 2nd project has a 3x3 Ravens Matrix that is solved
	-	The 4th project has images for 4x4 Ravens Matrix instead of text files. So intially image processing is done to read the images. These are stored and then solved as text files.
